If wanting to use GitHub, make sure you do a PULL and have the directory as shown below

Review
What was something new/helpful for you yesterday?
Do you have any questions?

first hand look at Git, push/pull
practice with own repos was exciting
GitHub 
VSCode +11
better than IntelliJ, painful there to debug
configuring
navigating around
not Visual Studio
integrated terminal
Node - taking Chrome V8 engine into a desktop application
servers, also nice command line tools
the mystery explained!
starting a server, in your development
nice to see how it fits together
many new things, +2
Opening Command Prompt from Windows Explorer
using the CLI is super huge now!
HTML5, CSS3, JS review
ES6
if you see let or const - ES6
bacticks `  same key as tilda
allows us to use single and double quotes
let band = `Guns ‘N Roses is “great” ! `
ES6 JavaScript - diff between var and let
var has issues
var doesnt have block scope, it escapes, cause for bugs
{  var x = 3 }    console.log(x)  // 3
{ let x = 3}   console.log(x)  //undefined
for (var x = 0; x<10; x++ ) {}
x is still accessible
var x = 3
var x = ‘Tuesday’  // this is allowed in JS
let x = 3;
let x = ‘abc’ // error already been declared
{ var x = new Date(); }   
x is still in scope after block
AJAX
helpful to see
TypeScript - allows you to add types
made much more popular by the likes of Angular
TypeScript IS ES6, PLUS more…
one idea is to give us what is coming in ES, but not available yet
before ES6, TS gave us class syntax
based upon the proposals for ES6

Review
What was something new/helpful for you yesterday?
Do you have any questions?
ES6
let
const
REST API
Http Methods: POST, GET, and…?
And…?
VSCode
extension for html tag wrap - Alt + W
Emmet abbreviations (work on other editors too)
Browsers
dev tools - some more and resources
debugging in browser 
breakpoints in JS
break on browser events
HTML5
semantic tags: nav 
IE11?
table caption for accessibility
seeing how things have changed - standards
marking up text, hands on was helpful
Accessibility Testing (Loona) 
which tools do you use?
JAWS screen reader
Voiceover
NVDA
WAT (Web Accessibility Toolbar)
Deque Axe tool (extension in chrome,FF)
Shims, Shivs, Polyfills
javascript to add in missing features
how to know HTML5 is being used?
<!doctype html> tells browser if it is HTML5
then can use semantic tags
Compiling code (not HTML - JavaScript)
EcmaScript 6 - doesnt work in browsers
Transpile from ES6 to ES5
in modern web project with ES6
file that is used for dependencies and scripts
package.json
would have an entry for transpiler
Babel and Traceur
package.json
dependencies
scripts
Keeping up to date
VSCode can tell by the lower left icon
Modules more to come in ch09
Browsers do not support modules
module loader, or bundler
#1 approach: WebPack, could use Browserify
Node: uses CommonJS syntax (require, module.exports)
ES6 Modules: Use import and export (Angular, React)
 
HAPPY Thursday!

Everything CSS was new
gradient background: https://cssgradient.io/blog/css-gradient-text/
text - font color   
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS
the browser is very helpful to understand CSS usage and how things work
CSS Zen Garden +2
order of CSS is important
specificity:   inline, id, class, html

Review:  To save time today please scroll down to here and type in your 
what was new or helpful yesterday
any questions you may have here 
JS - similar to other C based languages
syntax is very flexible, multiple ways
syntactic sugar
new Array()  or   [ ]
arr [ index ]  
new Object()  or { }
accessing:
use dot notation for properties
or use obj [“property”] 
allows you to use variable
function Person( ) { }   vs   class Person {   }
let p = new Person()  //would be the same
for constructor functions, adding methods, add to prototype
Person.prototype.doStuff = function () {}
for classes, this is done for you
 class Person {  doStuff() { }    }
Bootstrap, HTML5 Web Storage , Array Prototype, Javascript itself was new
HTML5 Form was very useful
